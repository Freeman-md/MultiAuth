# Multi-Tenant Authentication System for SaaS Applications

## Overview

This project focuses on building a **secure, scalable, and flexible multi-tenant authentication system** for a SaaS application. The application is designed for a property management agency that manages multiple properties, landlords, tenants, and maintenance staff, ensuring seamless authentication and authorization for all roles.

### Key Features

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Powered by Azure AD B2C for secure user authentication and tenant isolation.

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Ensures users (landlords, tenants, staff) can only access resources relevant to their role.

- **Scalability**: Easily onboard new properties (tenants) without requiring code changes.

- **Dynamic UI**: React.js provides role-based interfaces tailored for each type of user.

## Problem Statement

Managing authentication and authorization for multiple tenants in a SaaS application is challenging. Each tenant (e.g., property) must securely access the system without interfering with others.

In the context of a property management SaaS app:

- **Landlords** need access to manage properties and tenants.

- **Tenants** require restricted access to their own property information.

- **Maintenance Staff** need access to work orders across multiple tenants.

Without a proper authentication system:

1\. **Security risks** arise, such as unauthorized data access.

2\. **Scalability issues** occur when onboarding new tenants manually.

3\. **Operational inefficiencies** increase due to a lack of role-based flexibility.

## Solution

This project solves these challenges by implementing a **multi-tenant authentication system** with:

- **Azure AD B2C**: Manages secure user authentication and enforces tenant isolation.

- **.NET APIs**: Provides backend support with robust role-based access control.

- **React.js**: Creates a dynamic, tenant-specific user interface.

### Benefits

1\. **Security**: Tenant data is isolated and accessible only to authorized users.

2\. **Scalability**: Easily onboard new tenants without changing backend code.

3\. **Flexibility**: Role-based UI adapts seamlessly to landlords, tenants, or maintenance staff.

## Architecture

Below is an overview of the system architecture:

- **Azure AD B2C**:

  - Handles user authentication and directory management.

  - Provides roles and claims for tenant isolation.

- **Backend (.NET API)**:

  - Secures endpoints using Azure AD B2C tokens.

  - Implements role-based access control for tenant-specific data.

  - Manages properties, users, and roles.

- **Frontend (React.js)**:

  - Integrates with Azure AD B2C for login/logout.

  - Displays role-specific content dynamically (e.g., admin dashboard, tenant view).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Azure Account**: Set up an Azure AD B2C tenant.

- **Development Environment**:

    - .NET 8+ for backend.

    - Node.js 18+ for frontend.

- Basic knowledge of Azure AD B2C, .NET, and React.js.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for custom Azure AD B2C policies for advanced user flows.

- Enhance tenant isolation using additional claims and RBAC policies.

- Integrate reporting and analytics features for property management insights.
